            <p>
                In 1999 Roberto Souviron, founder of <b>TURISMO BUENOS AIRES</b>, had to travel to Buenos Aires to get his <u><a class="linkunlam" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_La_Matanza target="_blank">National University of La Matanza (UNLaM)</a></u>. Arriving in Buenos Aires, he wanted to explore this city on his own, which left him stunned by its beautiful architecture and delicious food. But not speaking the language, it was impossible for him to achieve his goal. So, together with her friend Josefa García, who was a tour guide 20 years ago, they decided to create a page that helps people from abroad who want to get to know Buenos Aires, without the need to hire an extra service. In addition, they decided to innovate by offering not only tourist places, but also still lifes, pizzerias and restaurants close to tourist places.<br>
                Today, it has more than 20 subsidiaries around the world. For example, <B>"TURISMO LIMA"</B>",<B>"TURISMO BOGOTÁ"</B>, among others. <br>
                On September 19, 2017, the company made its Wall Street debut. The stock launched at $26 in the initial public offering and closed up 24.5% on its first day of trading at $32.36. The price it reached represents a valuation of about USD 2,000 million. With this debut <b>TURISMO WASHINGTON D.C.</b> became known as one of the "unicorns" of Latin America, companies that in their stock market debut obtained a high market capitalization of over 1,000 million dollars.
